      <p>uhh i guess i have thoughts on the kpop industry and stuff, but honestly i feel like people dramaticize
        its problems; there are lots of issues with every industry out there, and society is just unwilling to change?
      i think it's best to focus on musicians as artists creating art, which is pretty contrary to what a kpop "idol" is even 
    supposed to be, but if you want to get rid of the toxicity / stigma around kpop, it's just good music in another language that
  you should try listening to!</p>
