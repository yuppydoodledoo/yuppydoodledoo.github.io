        <h2>math and cs stuff ℼ ⌨</h2>
        <p>my favorite math subjects are algebra and number theory. numbers are beautiful and number theory results are so powerful. lately i've been getting more into abstract algebra. 
          i have a huge stash of interesting math books that i need to read! 
          in the distant past i've also touched on analysis and topology and taken sneak peeks into diff geo. there is genuinely so much interesting math out there, and i've barely touched the surface.  </p>
          <p>books: aluffi's notes from the underground, axler's linear algebra done right, princeton's companion to mathematics and applied mathematics</p>
          <p>i'm also sorta a comp math person even though i'm a bit retired. math contests are fun though, and i attend many college tournaments. feel free to send me problems but you should understand that i'm pretty rusty oops.</p>
          <p>also if you're a girl in STEM please check out <a href="https://www.integirls.org/">INTEGIRLS</a> and <a href="https://bayarea.integirls.org/">INTEGIRLS Bay Area</a>! i'm involved with these two and i hope being a part of the INTEGIRLS community will motivate you to continue
            your math pursuits as much as they did for me! sign up for their mailing lists and participate in the competitions! i assure you that you will have a lot of fun! you should also check out athemath :)</p>
        <p>i've also gotten a bit into applied math stuff and mathematical modeling. i feel like i have trouble implementing theory sometimes, so doing math modeling contests is a great way 
          to execute that skill. i've also taken physics every year in hs and it's my favorite out of the "empirical" sciences. there's so much of the universe left to be understood.</p>
        <p>for cs i'm mainly into ml stuff, and recently llms? i guess my "journey" started off by watching 3blue1brown vids followed by some attempts to learn basic algorithms. now i like reading interesting papers 
          (reading academic writing takes practice) and ai tech content on various platforms (stuff on substack is rlly good, along with these <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/series/science-in-the-age-of-ai/">quanta articles</a>). 
          what is very exciting to me is how we can use ai to advance mathematically, like ai+lean workflows. a very recent development on <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/">alphaevolve</a>
          basically does this, advancing progress in the kissing number problem. another cool subsection of ai is in mechanistic interpretability. since ai has increasingly become intertwined with our lives, i think it's important to understand it better!
          and besides, if ai can write code now, we should focus on coding for ai instead of doing what ai can already do. hopefully i can get more into ai safety stuff :O</p>

      <div id="skating" class="section">  
        <h2>figure skating ₊˚｡❆</h2>
        <p>i've been skating for... 11 years now! i have all my doubles other than double axel :) i compete in excel and showcase, and i've passed my pre-gold tests in both singles and skating skills.
          i used to do toi and i also am on a hs skating team. i'm injured a lot oops</p>

        <h2>making the world a better place (mwab) ₊˚ʚ  ₊🌎˚✧ ﾟ.</h2>
        <p>this is one of my career goals in the long term. the impact of my work is very important to me, whether it's liking everyone's instagram stories (lol), volunteering my time, or performing research in things that matter!</p>
        <p>my personal philosophy isn't really solidified but there are bits and pieces that are important to me, and this underlies a substantial part of those pieces i guess?</p>

        <p>most recent book i read was tenth of december: stories by george saunders. i found "victory lap" very thought-provoking...</p>

        <h2>nascent hobbies and the miscellaneous 𖡎</h2>
        <p>i guess i <b>language-learn</b> through duolingo? i'm doing french, spanish, and some korean. 
          <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/annadeng08">here's my account</a>. the reason i'm reluctant to include this as a main interesting
          is because i'm nowhere as proficient as my progress seems to show. but in the future i definitely hope i can get better at these languages and 
          be able to understand/speak them!</p>
        <p>i also periodically <b>sketch</b> things from pinterest. totally not because it's part of my ceramics class hw. but to be fair sketching is fun!</p>
        <p>ah yes, i'm taking ceramics so i make things. they're not the best but um</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>here's my first pinch pot</p>
            <img src="images/ceram1.jpg" alt="firstpinchpot" width="100" height="76"></li>
          <li><p>here are two pinch pots and a mug and a sunflower and a grapevine thing</p>
