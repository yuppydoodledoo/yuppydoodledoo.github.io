      <div id="mathcs" class="section">  
        <h2>math and cs stuff ℼ ⌨</h2>
        <p>my favorite math subjects are algebra and number theory. numbers are beautiful and number theory results are so powerful. lately i've been getting more into abstract algebra. 
          i have a huge stash of interesting math books that i need to read! i also like linear algebra though i need to brush up on it. 
          in the distant past i've also touched on analysis and topology and taken sneak peeks into diff geo. there is genuinely so much interesting math out there, and i've barely touched the surface.  </p>
          <p>books: aluffi's notes from the underground, axler's linear algebra done right, needham's visual differential geometry, princeton's companion to mathematics and applied mathematics</p>
        <p>i've also gotten a bit into applied math stuff and mathematical modeling. i feel like i have trouble implementing theory sometimes, so doing math modeling contests is a great way 
          to execute that skill. i've also taken physics every year in hs and it's my favorite out of the "empirical" sciences. there's so much of the universe left to be understood.</p>
        <p>for cs i'm mainly into ml stuff, and recently mech interp? since ai has increasingly become intertwined with our lives, i think it's important to understand it better!
          and besides, if ai can write code now, we should focus on coding for ai instead of doing what ai can already do. </p>

      <div id="skating" class="section">  
        <h2>figure skating ₊˚｡❆</h2>
        <p>i've been skating for... 10 years now! i have all my doubles other than double axel :) i compete in excel and showcase, and i've passed my pre-gold tests in both singles and skating skills.
          i used to do toi and i also am on a hs skating team. i recently switched to aura skates (used to have sp teris) and have always used mk blades.</p>

        <p>this is one of my career goals in the long term. the impact of my work is very important to me, whether it's liking everyone's instagram stories (lol), volunteering my time, or performing research in things that matter!</p>

        <h2>nascent hobbies and the miscellaneous 𖡎</h2>
        <p>i guess i <b>language-learn</b> through duolingo? i'm doing french, spanish, and some korean. 
          <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/annadeng08">here's my account</a>. the reason i'm reluctant to include this as a main interesting
          is because i'm nowhere as proficient as my progress seems to show. but in the future i definitely hope i can get better at these languages and 
          be able to understand/speak them!</p>
        <p>i also periodically <b>sketch</b> things from pinterest. totally not because it's part of my ceramics class hw. but to be fair sketching is fun!</p>
        <p>ah yes, i'm taking ceramics so i make things. they're not the best but um</p>
        <h3>bucketlist</h3>
        <ul><li>cooking/baking</li>
        <li>driving</li>
        <li>webdev</li></ul>
        <p>for all the interests i have that have not come to fruition</p>
        <h3>abandoned hobbies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>i had a phase of crocheting. maybe i should pick that up again but i'm not the most deft. the hooks and yarn are still sitting untouched.
            pictures...
          </li>
          <li>i used to actually take art somewhat seriously.</li>
          <li>i used to play piano. i did not like it which is why i stopped.</li>
          <li>i used to dance competitively.</li>
          <li>i used to swim.</li>
