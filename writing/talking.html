      <p>i used to think people were plain scary. stranger danger! was the mantra fed into us throughout elementary school. there were also existential aspects to such ideas too.
        what if other people could really sense the thoughts i'm having? (actually, they kind of can by interpreting your body language). what if the world's just a simulation
        and people are just all copies of one another? what if someone says something mean to me? what if i open my mouth and i blurt out something wrong? what if what i said was 
        supposed to be a joke but then someone starts crying?...
      </p>
      <p>talking to other people takes quite a lot of effort. certainly some of the aforementioned questions are valid. whenever your mouth opens, you definitely need to put a filter
        to make sure you convey the right things. a jumbled mess neither helps you or others. for a while (and maybe still, i'm working on it!) i was not the best at talking eloquently. 
        but i absolutely love talking to people! it's still a bit hard to force yourself to talk to new people, because what the heck are you supposed to say first and all that. it does
        get awkward sometimes. you ask, how are you? they say, good. and the conversation seems to come to a halt. conversations do take effort though, so i guess the awkwardness is natural,
        oxymoronically. some people think i am weird. i'm fine with that; i'd rather be rambunctious than silent.
